Coding For Emotional Impact
===========================
This class is for anyone trying to use code to tell a story, compose music, or embue a physical object with the power of emotional expression. We will be looking at examples from a broad array of media and disciplines from the column structure of Greek temples to music (classical and contemporary) to poetry by Bob Dylan and Seamus Heaney to paintings by Mark Rothko to story-driven video games like Red Dead Redemption and yes Youtube cat videos. 

You will be working from code examples and simple interfaces I will create to help you play with different computational techniques. Our aim isn't to invent fancy new algorithms. Instead we're using computation and programming as a tool to help us decode the mechanisms that drive compelling emotional arcs.

## Syllabus (Work in Progress)
###Week 1: Seeing, Hearing, Sensing, Feeling Through the Lens of Patterns
- What is narrative arc? What is composition? What are its basic building blocks?
- What does it mean to compose narrative arc computationally?
- What is a pattern? When does a pattern cease to be a pattern?
- Can patterns be emotional?

##### HW 1: Collect 100 examples of compelling pattern-driven compositions. Pick 10 to talk about in class the following week.

### Weeks 2, 3: The Ebb and Flow of Micro Emotional Arcs
- Drumming Exercise
- Patterns that swell with anticipation, crest and die off
- Repeating patterns using arithmetic and simple periodic wave functions.
- Math Review: What is a wave function anyway?
- Modulating wave functions with frequency and amplitude.
- Recursive wave functions.

##### HW 2: Assign an arbitrary emotion to each person. Create 3 computational interpretations of your emotion by simply animating a rectangle on the screen with a wave function. Ask at least 3 people how it makes them feel. No leading questions!
##### HW 3: Apply it to your medium of choice. 

### Weeks 4, 5: Playing with Timing and Pacing and Pacing and Timing
- Embodying pacing: Walking down Broadway.
- Extending attention span.
- Building tension.
- Playing with the rate of change.
- When does change become perceptible?
- Linear versus geometric growth.
- Introduce the Story Grapher.

##### HW 4: Take your homework from Week 3 and use the Story Grapher to generate 10 more interpretations, this time try to interpret at least 3 distinct emotions. 
##### HW 5: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 6: DisrupInterruption
- How do you establish a pattern?
- Once you've established it, how do you break it?
- What is monotony? What is surprise?
- Defining ratios and proportions with linear and non-linear scaling.
- Judicious use of random() and noise().

##### HW 6: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 7: Unpredictaprobability
- Using probability to generate "unpredictable" patterns that disorient and destabilize.

##### HW 7: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 8: Momentous Occasions and Catastrophic Events
- Establishing landmark events.
- Building up to a grand finale.
- Orchestrating a disaster.
- Defining conditions to set thresholds.

##### HW 8: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 9,10: Pulling It All Together
- A polyphonic model for composing narrative and emotional arc.

##### HW 9: Design 3 models for your final project proposal.
##### HW 10: Pick 1 of your designs and flesh it out.

### Week 11: Small group presentations / discussions of final project.

### Week 12: Final project presentations

## Class Description
Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. We strive to provoke these reactions when we compose a piece of music or author a story.

What are we actually talking about? Narrative and emotional arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.

But what does it mean to compose a story or a piece of music in terms of rules and patterns expressed in code? In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies to compose patterns of events capable of producing emotional impact. 

The class is agnostic to medium. "Narrative events" can be shifts in color in a painting, shifts in meter in music or shifts in the emotional state of the protagonist of an interactive story. You define the events. The class provides the techniques for shaping those events in dynamic ways over time.

The class is also as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and dissecting compelling examples of composition as we do to writing code. 

Assignments will alternate between programming exercises done in Processing and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice, in the programming language of your choice. Since this is as much a course about perception as it is about code, user testing your creations will be as important as the creations themselves!
