Coding For Emotional Impact
===========================
This class is for anyone trying to use code to tell a story, compose music, or embue a physical object with the power of emotional expression. We will be looking at examples from a broad array of media and disciplines from the column structure of Greek temples to music (classical and contemporary) to poetry by Bob Dylan and Seamus Heaney to paintings by Mark Rothko to story-driven video games like Red Dead Redemption and yes Youtube cat videos. 

You will be working from code examples and simple interfaces I will create to help you play with different computational techniques. Our aim isn't to invent fancy new algorithms. Instead we're using computation and programming as a tool to help us decode the mechanisms that drive compelling emotional arcs.

## Syllabus (Work in Progress)
###Week 1: Seeing, Hearing, Sensing, Feeling Through the Lens of Patterns
- What is narrative arc? What is composition? What are its basic building blocks?
- What does it mean to compose narrative arc computationally?
- What is a pattern? When does a pattern cease to be a pattern?
- Can patterns be emotional?
- [Notes](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Week-1)

####Homework: Create your own human "chamber music" piece.
- Duration: **1-5 minutes**
- Collect 5-6 patterns from the "real world" to contribute to your group. They can be images, sound, video clips, objects, etc. Document your patterns in your blog post and write 1-2 sentences on the emotional impact of each pattern.
- The piece does not have to be sound-based, but it must be a live performance.
- You can make use of mechanical devices: metronomes, lightswitches, fans, etc...
- You may want to consider having a conductor, but that is not required.
- **Rehearse** your piece in front of at least 2 other people.
- Document the rehearsal on video.
- Submit a link to your blog post (you only need 1 per group) to the [Homework Wiki](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Homework)

## Class Description
Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. We strive to provoke these reactions when we compose a piece of music or author a story.

What are we actually talking about? Narrative and emotional arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.

But what does it mean to compose a story or a piece of music in terms of rules and patterns expressed in code? In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies to compose patterns of events capable of producing emotional impact. 

The class is agnostic to medium. "Narrative events" can be shifts in color in a painting, shifts in meter in music or shifts in the emotional state of the protagonist of an interactive story. You define the events. The class provides the techniques for shaping those events in dynamic ways over time.

The class is also as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and dissecting compelling examples of composition as we do to writing code. 

Assignments will alternate between programming exercises done in Processing and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice, in the programming language of your choice. Since this is as much a course about perception as it is about code, user testing your creations will be as important as the creations themselves!
